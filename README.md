# pesticide-data-tool
A python web scraper that analyzes data on pesticides from the University of Hertfordshire's Pesticide Properties Database. Currently the tool checks each pesticide in the database and will return a list of those that are rated low risk in three categories: environmental fate, ecotoxicity, and human health hazard.
